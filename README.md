# Asteroids Backend

## What's this?

This is one of my experimentations with express.js.

## Okay, so how do I run this?

If you know what this repo is about before reading the paragraphs above, please follow these steps if you really need.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
  - LTS version is a good one with this.

### 1. Clone a repo

Not really worth listing this here, but I want to be precise with my steps.

### 2. `npm install`

Let there be dependencies.

### 3. Run the project!

#### For PowerShell (Recommended, but no matter):

`PS> $env:DEBUG='myapp:*'; npm start`

#### For Mac or Linux users:

`$ DEBUG=myapp:* npm start`

#### For Windows command prompt:

`> set DEBUG=myapp:* & npm start`

### 4. The server is up.

It's in localhost:3001
